								The Lab for the Analysis of Zombie Activity and Research into Undead
								Simulations (LAZARUS) was founded at Texas Tech University in 2014 as
								the result of the synergistic efforts of the Department of Mathematics
								Statistics, the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)
								Center for Outreach, Research  Education (STEM-CORE), and a number
								of independent initiatives funded by the National Science Foundation. The
								lab is designed to serve two purposes: (1) support research opportunities for
								undergraduate and graduate students, and (2) support K12 outreach efforts
								designed to increase awareness and interest in STEM academic and career
								pathways. While the lab hosts a number of resources designed to support
								these objectives, a supercomputer branded as the Schoenberg Cluster is
								featured as the lab&#x2019;s centerpiece.

								About the LAZARUS Project
							%h2
								origin
							%p
								The lab’s co-directors - Dr. Brock Williams (research) and Dr. Jerry Dwyer (outreach) - currently oversee the efforts of one graduate researcher (John Calhoun, MS) and four undergraduate researchers. The STEM-CORE also provides administrative staff support for the lab’s outreach activities. LAZARUS has taken several years and significant effort to establish, but the lab is finally a reality! Beginning in the Spring 2015 academic semester, the lab will also facilitate a newly developed undergraduate-level mathematical computing course designed to train students to utilize the Schoenberg Cluster.
							%h2
								Compute Cluster
							%p
								The Schoenberg Cluster is a unique resource at Texas Tech as it is the largest
								and most powerful graphics processing unit (GPU) cluster on campus. As
								the design and assembly of the cluster was driven by Texas Tech graduate
								and undergraduate students with only support and guidance from faculty, it
								has proven to be an especially powerful recruitment and retention tool. In
								keeping with the theme of student-driven inquiry, priority access is given to
								graduate and undergraduate students who might be denied access to other,
								more traditional high performance computing resources.
							%h2
								Our Future
							%p
								Moving forward, the LAZARUS project aims to also support the creation
								of new technologies. In the race to create the next generation of high
								performance computing, many challenges need to be tackled. Power
								consumption is becoming a limiting factor for larger computers. We are
								working on developing a new supercomputer architecture centered on
								reconfigurable computing and additive manufacturing. Reconfigurable
								computing using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology has
								the ability to create more efficient software and hardware at lower costs and
								with more efficient rates of power consumption. Additive manufacturing in
								the form of 3D printed electronics lowers the deployment time and
								development cost of new computers. LAZARUS is uniquely engaging
								undergraduate and graduate students in exploring these cutting edge areas
								of research.

							%p 
								The LAZARUS project now includes the NVIDIA GPU Education Center. As a part of the GPU Education Center, LAZARUS is committed to advancing the state of parallel education using CUDA C/C++. NVIDIA equipment, including a Tesla K 40 and five Titan Black GPU's will be added to the lab, to enhance the coding education and possibilities. This equipment will be used in a programming class, housed under the Department of Mathematics &amp; Statistics. This class will allow undergraduate students interested in programming an opportunity to do so, with top of the line equipment and technology.

								Schoenberg Cluster Developments
							%p The Schoenberg Cluster features a collection of computing nodes (motherboards with two GPUs and memory but no hard drives), storage nodes (motherboards with less processing power but with plenty of memory and hard drive capacity), and a single head node which manages operations across the cluster. These CAD images show a preview of the case that is currently under construction to house the cluster.
							%p The images below trace out the evolution of the external case design and implementation. A team of undergraduate industrial engineering interns under the supervision of faculty in the TTU Department of Industrial Engineering spearheaded the case design and fabrication. fabrication
